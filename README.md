# 🚀 AI-Powered Revenue Growth Strategy for a D2C Startup

**Author:** Jagadeesh N  
**Goal:** Design a data-driven strategy to maximize revenue through A/B testing, customer segmentation, causal inference, and uplift modeling.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project simulates a **marketing experiment (A/B test)** and builds a full **data-to-decision pipeline** — from feature engineering to causal inference and predictive uplift modeling.  
The focus is on identifying **high-value customer segments** and quantifying the **true causal impact** of marketing interventions on conversion and revenue.

## 🧩 Project Workflow

| Step | Notebook | Description |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 🧪 **Step 01** | `Step_01_AB_Test_Simulation.ipynb` | Simulate an A/B testing dataset with random treatment assignment, revenue, and conversion metrics. |
| ⚙️ **Step 02** | `Step_02_Feature_Engineering_Baseline_Models.ipynb` | Perform data preprocessing, feature scaling, and train baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for conversion prediction. |
| 🧮 **Step 03** | `Step_03_Causal_Inference_Uplift_Modeling.ipynb` | Apply Causal Inference using **DoWhy** and **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)** to estimate treatment effects and individual uplift scores. |
| 📈 **Step 04** | `Step_04_Revenue_Simulation_Strategic_Recommendations.ipynb` | Simulate revenue uplift based on predicted treatment effects and provide actionable business insights for campaign targeting. |
